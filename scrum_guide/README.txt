LeSS Scrum Guide Derivation History and Styling:

The LeSS Scrum Guide is philosophically far more aligned with the 2017 Scrum Guide than it is with the 2020 Scrum Guide. Prior to the new LeSS Scrum Guide, the LeSS community stayed with the 2017 Scrum Guide, and intentionally ignored the 2020 version. As such you will see some language in the LeSS Scrum Guide going back to the 2017 Scrum Guide. 

In terms of literary style, Bas Vodde leaned towards the literary styling of the 2020 Scrum Guide. 
Therefore, you will also see text taken from the 2020 Scrum Guide.

Translation of Proper Names:

When translating the LeSS Scrum Guide, I tried to use the same translation of proper names as seen in prior Scrum Guide translations.

Consistently referencing the English versions of proper names as well as the translated versions is very helpful to the reader. So much of the content available is only available in English. This is as true of the many diagrams regarding LeSS, as it is regarding the text. 

I achieved this by always including the English proper names in parenthesis and italics just after every Spanish usage of a proper name. I intentionally continued this practice throughout, not just with the first encounter of a proper name. This is largely the same pattern you will see with the prior Spanish translations.

For example, "Product Owner" becomes "Propietario del Producto (Product Owner)".

--------------------
Started With Google Translate:

I used Google Translate for the first pass at the translation. I then manually read what was produced and looked for any obvious mistakes. 

I frequently had to correct translations of the proper names, aligning them with the translations used in the 2017 and 2020 Scrum Guides.

I also would occasionally catch sentences which didn't quite seem to be properly translated, and I would play around with different translations until they seemed to be more accurately translated.

The most likely errors are going to be errors in conjugation, and similar small errors. 

It is unlikely there are many if any significant errors in terms of failure to properly translate intent. Yet, those are the ones I am most concerned about proof readers catching.
