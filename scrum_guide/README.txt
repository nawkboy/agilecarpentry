Translation Context:

It is very useful to compare proper names from previous translated versions of the Scrum Guide when attempting to translate the LeSS Scrum Guide.

The LeSS Scrum Guide is philosophically far more aligned with the 2017 Scrum Guide than it is with the 2020 Scrum Guide. As such you will see some language in the LeSS Scrum Guide going back to the 2017 Scrum Guide. Prior to the new LeSS Scrum Guide the LeSS Community simply stayed with the 2017 Scrum Guide and intentionally ignored the 2020 version.

In terms of literary style, Bas leaned towards the styling of the 2020 Scrum Guide. So you will see a good bit of text taken from the 2020 Scrum Guide as well.

I find it is important to reference the English versions of the proper names within the LeSS Scrum Guide whenever they are used. This makes it easier for a Spanish reader to more easily reference the many English only diagrams. I did this using the same style as the previous Spanish translations of the Scrum Guide.

For example, "Product Owner" becomes "Propietario del Producto (Product Owner)".

Many of the proper names can be translated into Spanish several ways. I have made sure to always use the Spanish versions of proper names found in the Spanish translations of the 2017 and 2020 Scrum Guide.
