# Short-Form Reading

Before dedicating the time to read through an entire book, most people prefer to read a few articles or case studies first. The links below provide a good place to start.

Before settling down to read [Book 3: Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS  (2015)](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Craig-Larman/dp/0321985710){:target="_blank"}, 

* [Why LeSS](https://less.works/less/framework/why-less){:target="_blank"}: Provides a high-level survey of the motivations around LeSS.

* [Introduction To LeSS](https://less.works/less/framework/introduction){:target="_blank"}: Provides a summary overview of LeSS.

* [LeSS Rules](https://less.works/less/rules){:target="_blank"}: The LeSS Rules are the definition of the LeSS Framework.

* [LeSS Complete Picture](https://less.works/resources/LeSS-complete-picture.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Covers the following topics: _LeSS Principles_, _LeSS Rules_, _LeSS Guides_ index for book 3, and _LeSS Experiments_ indices for books 1 and 2.

* [LeSS Website](https://less.works/){:target="_blank"}:
Reference style arrangement of _LeSS framework_ information using a large overview diagram as a navigational launch pad.

* [LeSS Version of Scrum Guide](https://less.works/less/scrum-guide){:target="_blank"}: As newer versions of the official Scrum Guide have been released, the articulation and arguably the intent has drifted. In an effort to avoid confusion within the LeSS community, a LeSS Version of the Scrum Guide has recently been published.

# Long-Form Reading

When you are ready to settle down for a deep dive into LeSS, the long-form narative structure of a book is often best.

* [Book 3: Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS  (2015)](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Craig-Larman/dp/0321985710){:target="_blank"}:
This is the 3rd LeSS book. It provides a better high-level overview of LeSS than the first two books. The LeSS "Guides" are all found in this book. In retrospect, this is perhaps the book Craig and Bas should have written first.

* [Book 1: Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum (2009)](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961){:target="_blank"}:
1st LeSS book. Contains a multitude of “Experiments”, almost like a recipe book. The 3rd book is a better book to start with for most people.

* [Book 2: Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Large, Multisite, and Offshore Product Development with Large-Scale Scrum (2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406){:target="_blank"}:
2nd LeSS book. Contains a multitude of “Experiments”, almost like a recipe book. As the sub-title suggests this book focuses more on multisite and offshore development than the 1st book does. The 3rd book is a better book to start with for most people.

# LeSS Adopters

# My LeSS Case Study

To become a LeSS trainer one must have implemented a non-trivial LeSS adoption, written an extensive experience report regarding the effort, and gone through an extensive editorial process used as a mentorship scaffold for refining the thought process of the candidate trainer. It is not unlike a doctoral thesis in some regards. The level of effort and depth of experience required to go through the process is one reason there are only 26 LeSS trainers globally at present.

My LeSS case study regarding a [Large Server Hardware Company](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company){:target="_blank"} provides a hands-on experience report of my efforts at one particular client. By reading this, you and I will have at least one concrete reference context for discussing real-world application of LeSS. There are [other great case studies](https://less.works/case-studies){:target="_blank"} worth reading, but none that I can personally speak to at the same level of depth I can my own.

I also have a [business focused summary]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/business-summary-of-case-study/) of my case study which you may find useful.

If it makes sense, I can arrange a call with "Mitya" in my case study. I am grateful to  have developed a lifelong friendship with “Mitya” and his family during the time covered by my case study.

Agile Carpentry can help solve that problem for most any desired language which a client wishes to sponsor translation for.
