# Training Venue Details

Downtown Baltimore turns out to be the best choice for the course, as it provides the best balance of logistics and cost.

The downtown Baltimore Amtrak station (BAL) is a short Uber ride to the downtown hotels, which makes it super easy and quick for participants to travel from New York City (2h20m via Acela), and Philadelphia (1h10m via Acela). There is also a light rail link from BWI airport to downtown Baltimore for those of us who are flying.

I am currently planning to host the event in the [Kimpton Hotel Monaco Baltimore Inner Harbor](https://www.monaco-baltimore.com/){:target="_blank"}. I will bind the event space concurrent with transitioning out of pre-registration. The Kimpton Monaco is situated along with other 4 and 5 star event hotels in the upscale Inner Harbor area.

Lunch each day is included in the price of the course.
